26/01/2026 19:38 - Launcher Web & RTX 50 Support - Beta_v047
****************************************************************************************************
- What's New:
  *RTX 50 Critical Fix: Fixed a critical crash when generating characters on new NVIDIA GPUs (RTX 5070, 5080, 5090).
  (Since I don't own an RTX 50-series card, I couldn't test this fix directly, but in theory, it should be solved. I await your victory chants here!)

  *AI Engine Update: Upgraded local AI brain for maximum compatibility with latest hardware.
  *New Launcher: Real-time news and updates from the official website.

26/01/2026 06:49 - Integración Web Documentación - Beta_v045
****************************************************************************************************
- What's New:
  *User Manual and Changelog now load directly from our official website, ensuring you always have the latest information without patching. Includes smart offline fallback.

  *We have reinforced game stability so it never hangs at start. Also, merchants returned from their holidays in limbo: they now appear correctly, have stock on shelves, and respect world setting (no magic potions in the future).

  *Fixed a bug preventing AI parameter modification and AI model selection, which blocked users with limited VRAM from playing.
  **If you need to modify AI parameters, I strongly recommend trying first by lowering VRAM % to 85%, restart and test. If this is not enough, check that GPU VRAM is not being used by other non-game processes (restart PC if needed, close apps using VRAM). If after lowering VRAM amount even to 70% it still doesn't work, I do not recommend lowering further because the game won't manage prompts sent to AI. In that case, the only remaining option is to downgrade to a lower model, reset AI parameters to automatic, and restart.**
