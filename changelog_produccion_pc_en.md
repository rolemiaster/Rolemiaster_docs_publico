28/01/2026 22:49 - Estabilización y Mejoras de IA - Beta_v049
****************************************************************************************************
- What's New:
  We've polished the gameplay experience with key fixes and a new visual tool:

  * **Clean & Reliable Inventory:** No more "ghost items" or strangely named objects appearing in your backpack. We check that everything you loot or buy actually exists in the game world.
  * **Fluid Dialogues:** We fixed those annoying buttons that sometimes showed up as "Unknown" or didn't respond. NPC dialogue options will now always display the correct text.
  * **Robust Character Generation:** Creating your hero is now a rock-solid process. We've resolved conflicts that sometimes left character sheets incomplete or with incorrect stats when combining biography and gameplay data.
  * **New AI Status Bar:** Now you can see the machine's brain at work! We've added a status bar at the top showing response speed and memory usage in real-time. You'll always know if the AI is "thinking" up your next adventure.

****************************************************************************************************
26/01/2026 19:38 - Launcher Web & RTX 50 Support - Beta_v047
****************************************************************************************************
- What's New:

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > **DUE TO COMPATIBILITY REASONS, IT IS NECESSARY TO DELETE THE PREVIOUS DB, OTHERWISE IT IS VERY LIKELY TO CAUSE ERRORS IN AI CONFIGURATION**
  > **(Solution: Click on the Launcher gear icon ⚙️ -> Delete Database)**

  *RTX 50 Critical Fix: Fixed a critical crash when generating characters on new NVIDIA GPUs (RTX 5070, 5080, 5090).
  (Since I don't own an RTX 50-series card, I couldn't test this fix directly, but in theory, it should be solved. I await your victory chants here!)

  *AI Engine Update: Upgraded local AI brain for maximum compatibility with latest hardware.
  *New Launcher: Real-time news and updates from the official website.

26/01/2026 06:49 - Integración Web Documentación - Beta_v045
****************************************************************************************************
- What's New:
  *User Manual and Changelog now load directly from our official website, ensuring you always have the latest information without patching. Includes smart offline fallback.

  *We have reinforced game stability so it never hangs at start. Also, merchants returned from their holidays in limbo: they now appear correctly, have stock on shelves, and respect world setting (no magic potions in the future).

  *Fixed a bug preventing AI parameter modification and AI model selection, which blocked users with limited VRAM from playing.
  **If you need to modify AI parameters, I strongly recommend trying first by lowering VRAM % to 85%, restart and test. If this is not enough, check that GPU VRAM is not being used by other non-game processes (restart PC if needed, close apps using VRAM). If after lowering VRAM amount even to 70% it still doesn't work, I do not recommend lowering further because the game won't manage prompts sent to AI. In that case, the only remaining option is to downgrade to a lower model, reset AI parameters to automatic, and restart.**
